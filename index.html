Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not o
nly five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with th
e release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
 Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
 software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
